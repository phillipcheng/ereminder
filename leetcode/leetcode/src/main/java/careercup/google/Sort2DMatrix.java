/**
 Given a 2D matrix of integers, sort it such that: 

- every row is sorted in ascending order from left to right 
- every column is sorted in ascending order from top to down 
- all items in the same row are unique 

You may assume the input matrix is always valid, meaning that such a sort is always possible. 

For example: 
for input matrix

1 3 5
3 2 4
the output could be any of the following: 
valid output #1:

1 3 4
2 3 5
valid output #2:

1 2 3
3 4 5
valid output #3:

1 3 4
2 3 5
One kinda trivial solution is to sort the 2D matrix column wise. 
For example, you can push all items into a heap and pop one after another, 
putting it into the matrix column after column. 
This would be a `O(n lg n)` time complexity where `n` is the number of items in the matrix, i.e., `n = rows*cols`. 
Can you design a more efficient algorithm? 

Follow-up: What if all items in the same column are also required to be unique
