public class StringCanShuffle {
/*
 Define a function that can detect whether the characters of a string can be shuffled without 
 repeating same characters as one other's neighbors. E.g. :
apple >> alpep, so valid 
a >> a, valid 
aa >> aa, invalid/impossible 
aab >> aba, valid 
aaaabbcc >> acabacab, valid 
etc. 
You do not have to find one representation, just have to detect if it is possible or not!
