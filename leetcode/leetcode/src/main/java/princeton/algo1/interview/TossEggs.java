Egg drop. Suppose that you have an N-story building (with floors 1 through N) and plenty of eggs. 
An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or higher and does not break otherwise. 
Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations on the number of eggs and tosses:
Version 0: 1 egg, ¡ÜT tosses.
Version 1: lgN eggs and lgN tosses.
Version 2: lgT eggs and 2lgT tosses.
Version 3: 2 eggs and 2*sqr(N) tosses.
Version 4: 2 eggs and 2*sqrt(2)*sqrt(T) tosses
