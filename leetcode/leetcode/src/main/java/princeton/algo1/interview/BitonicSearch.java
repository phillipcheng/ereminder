/*
Search in a bitonic array. An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
Write a program that, given a bitonic array of N distinct integer values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.
Standard version: Use 3lgN compares in the worst case.
Signing bonus: Use 2lgN compares in the worst case (and prove that no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than 2lgN compares in the worst case).
